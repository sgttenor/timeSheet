##### Phase 1

# Employee Data Management - Design

## File

* *None*

## Instructions

* For the next 20 minutes, focus all your efforts on creating the application layout for your site.

* This phase involves both:

  * Creating the overall HTML/CSS/Bootstrap Layout

  * Creating the initial `.on("click")` event that will dynamically trigger new HTML rows to be generated.

* This phase DOES NOT involve sending or receiving data to Firebase.

* If you finish early:

  * Continue refining the design! Take things to the next level. Make this application portfolio-grade!

  * Begin reading about `push({})` and `.on("child_added")` in the Firebase documentation.


##### Phase 2

# Employee Data Management - Push

## File

* *None*

## Instructions

* Using your newfound knowledge of the `.push({})` method, create the code necessary to push employee data into the database upon clicking the `submit` button on your webpage.

* **NOTE:** Don't worry about getting the data to display in the HTML just yet. Just focus on getting data pushed to the database.

* If you finish early, begin reading about `.on("child_added")` in the Firebase documentation and/or the MomentJS library.


##### Phase 3

# Employee Data Management - Child_Added

## File

* *None*

## Instructions

* Using your newfound knowledge of the `.on("child_added")` method, begin to retrieve your employee data from the database and populating the records into your table.

* **NOTE:** Don't worry about calculating Months Worked or the Total Billed just yet. Just focus on retrieving the data that is already in the database.

* If you finish easily, continue refining the aesthetics of your website, consider incorporating "update" or "delete" employee buttons, or begin reading up on the MomentJS library.

##### Phase 4

# Employee Data Management - Datetime

## File

* *None*

## Instructions

* Use your newfound momentJS knowledge to calculate the number of months worked and, subsequently, the total amount billed.
